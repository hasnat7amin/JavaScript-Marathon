## Question No 2

### What is the difference between client-side and server-side?

Client-side means that the processing takes place on the user’s computer. It requires browsers to run the scripts on the client machine without involving any processing on the server.

Server-side means that the processing takes place on a web server.

This processing is important to execute the tasks required by the user on the web. Since the client-side script is executed on the client’s computer, it is visible to the client. On the other hand, the server-side script is executed in the server; hence, it is not visible to the users.

### Explain Scope in JavaScript?

Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript. The two types of scope are local and global:

Global variables are those declared outside of a block
Local variables are those declared inside of a block

``` // Initialize a global variable
var species = "human";
 
function transform() {
  // Initialize a local, function-scoped variable
  var species = "werewolf";
  console.log(species);
}

// Log the global and local variable
console.log(species);
transform();
console.log(species); ```
